-----------What did you learn? What did you know already?-----------

A whole bunch about constructors, operator overloads and stuff. Also I got a better understanding of scopes, instances, assignmentcalls and junk.


-----------What was difficult in the lab? How did you overcome it?-----------

I spent most of my time on task 1, learning how and when I needed constructors and different overloads.
I had alot of errors, most were rooted in the fact that I needed to overload certain operators.
after the first task I had a decent enough grip on things for the other tasks not to be so troublesome. 


-----------How can the lab be improved?-----------

I don´t know.


-----------Additionally, write an estimate how many hours you spent on this lab.-----------

10+
